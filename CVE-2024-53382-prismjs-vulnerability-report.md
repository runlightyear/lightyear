# CVE-2024-53382: PrismJS DOM Clobbering Vulnerability Report

## Executive Summary

Your project has a transitive dependency on PrismJS v1.29.0 through Docusaurus, which contains a DOM Clobbering vulnerability (CVE-2024-53382) that could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability has been fixed in PrismJS v1.30.0, but Docusaurus has not yet updated to include this version.

## Vulnerability Details

### CVE Information
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-53382
- **Type**: DOM Clobbering leading to XSS
- **CVSS Score**: 4.9 (Medium)
- **Affected Version**: PrismJS <= 1.29.0
- **Fixed Version**: PrismJS >= 1.30.0

### Technical Details
The vulnerability allows DOM Clobbering attacks where an attacker can inject HTML elements that shadow the `document.currentScript` lookup. This can result in XSS attacks even when the injected content contains HTML but not direct JavaScript code.

## Impact on Your Project

### Dependency Chain
```
lightyear (your project)
└── @docusaurus/preset-classic: 3.8.1
    └── @docusaurus/theme-classic
        └── prism-react-renderer: 2.4.1
            └── prismjs: 1.29.0 (VULNERABLE)
```

### Affected Components
The vulnerability affects the documentation site built with Docusaurus, specifically:
- `/apps/docs/` - Documentation website
- Any code syntax highlighting features using PrismJS

### Risk Assessment
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Exploitability**: Requires ability to inject HTML content
- **Impact**: Potential XSS attacks on documentation viewers

## Current Status

### Why Can't We Update?
Dependabot reports: "The latest possible version of prismjs that can be installed is 1.29.0. The earliest fixed version is 1.30.0."

This is because:
1. PrismJS is not a direct dependency but comes through Docusaurus
2. Docusaurus v3.8.1 (current version) depends on `prism-react-renderer` which depends on PrismJS 1.29.0
3. There's no compatible version of the intermediate packages that supports PrismJS 1.30.0 yet

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Actions

1. **Monitor Docusaurus Updates**
   - Check for new Docusaurus releases that include the fixed PrismJS version
   - Follow the Docusaurus GitHub repository for updates

2. **Assess Risk**
   - Review if your documentation accepts user-generated content
   - Check if any untrusted HTML could be rendered in code blocks

3. **Temporary Mitigations**
   - Ensure strict Content Security Policy (CSP) headers on documentation site
   - Sanitize any user-provided content before rendering
   - Avoid rendering untrusted HTML in documentation

### Long-term Actions

1. **Track the Issue**
   - Monitor Docusaurus GitHub for issues related to this CVE
   - Consider opening an issue if one doesn't exist

2. **Prepare for Update**
   - When Docusaurus releases an update, test it thoroughly
   - Plan for immediate deployment once available

## Verification Commands

To check current versions:
```bash
# Check PrismJS version in lock file
grep -A5 -B5 "prismjs" pnpm-lock.yaml

# Check Docusaurus version
grep "@docusaurus" apps/docs/package.json
```
