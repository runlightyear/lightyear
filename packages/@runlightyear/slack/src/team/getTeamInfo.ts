 * Arguments
 * Required arguments
 * token
 * token
 * ¬∑Required
 * Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.
 *
 * Example
 * xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx
 * Optional arguments
 * domain
 * string
 * ¬∑Optional
 * Query by domain instead of team (only when team is null). This only works for domains in the same enterprise as the querying team token. This also expects the domain to belong to a team and not the enterprise itself. This is the value set up for the 'Joining This Workspace' workspace setting. If it contains more than one domain, the field will contain multiple comma-separated domain values. If no domain is set, the field is empty.
 *
 * team
 * string
 * ¬∑Optional
 * Team to get info about; if omitted, will return information about the current team.
 *
 * Example
 * T1234567890
 * Usage info
 * This method provides information about your team.
 *
 * Team Icon
 * If a team has not yet set a custom icon, the value of team.icon.image_default will be true.
 *
 * If the team belongs to an Enterprise Grid, the enterprise_id and enterprise_name fields will indicate the owning enterprise organization.
 *
 * Example responses
 * Common successful response
 * Typical success response
 *
 * {
 *     "ok": true,
 *     "team": {
 *         "id": "T12345",
 *         "name": "My Team",
