# Micromatch ReDoS Vulnerability Fix

## Summary
Fixed a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the `micromatch` package by forcing all instances to use version 4.0.8 or higher.

## Vulnerability Details
- **Package**: micromatch (npm)
- **Affected versions**: < 4.0.8
- **Fixed version**: 4.0.8
- **Severity**: Moderate
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-4067
- **GHSA ID**: GHSA-952p-6rrq-rcjv

## Issue
The vulnerability was introduced transitively through:
- `@changesets/cli 2.29.4` → `fast-glob 3.3.1` → `micromatch 4.0.5`
- `jest-message-util 29.7.0` → `micromatch 4.0.5`

## Solution
Added a pnpm override in `package.json` to force all instances of micromatch to use version 4.0.8:

```json
"pnpm": {
  "overrides": {
    // ... other overrides ...
    "micromatch@<4.0.8": "4.0.8"
  }
}
```

## Verification
After running `pnpm install`, confirmed that:
1. No instances of `micromatch 4.0.5` remain in `pnpm-lock.yaml`
2. All packages now use `micromatch 4.0.8`
3. The project builds successfully with the updated dependency

## Impact
This fix prevents potential ReDoS attacks where malicious input could cause the regular expression matching in micromatch to consume excessive CPU time, potentially causing the application to hang or slow down significantly.
