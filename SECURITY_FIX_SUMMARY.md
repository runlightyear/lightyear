# Security Fix Summary: CVE-2024-43799 (send package vulnerability)

## Issue
Dependabot Alert #49 reported a vulnerability in the `send` npm package:
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-43799
- **GHSA ID**: GHSA-m6fv-jmcg-4jfg
- **Severity**: Low (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L)
- **Affected versions**: send < 0.19.0
- **Fixed version**: send >= 0.19.0

## Vulnerability Details
The vulnerability involves template injection that can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Passing untrusted user input to `SendStream.redirect()` may execute untrusted code, even after sanitizing the input.

## Resolution
Updated the project's `package.json` to include pnpm overrides that force secure versions:

```json
"pnpm": {
  "overrides": {
    "send@<0.19.0": "0.19.0",
    "serve-static@<1.16.0": "1.16.0"
  }
}
```

## Verification
After running `pnpm install`:
- ✅ Vulnerable `send@0.18.0` has been removed from the dependency tree
- ✅ Secure `send@0.19.0` is now being used
- ✅ `serve-static@1.16.0` (patched version) is maintained

## Impact
This fix addresses the template injection vulnerability without requiring any code changes. All packages depending on `send` will now use the secure version 0.19.0 or higher.

## Recommendation
Keep monitoring for security updates and ensure the pnpm overrides are maintained until all direct dependencies update to use secure versions of these packages.
