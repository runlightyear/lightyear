# Model Connector Examples

Note: Each example should demonstrate type inference by using the sync connector in a way that shows the types are properly inferred. This helps verify that the TypeScript types are working correctly.

## Define a basic model connector that works with a rest api and a model from a collection

**_ Example goes here _**

## Define a model connector that works with a rest api and a model from a collection and has a list method

**_ Example goes here - should use the list method to demonstrate type inference _**

## Define a model connector that works with a rest api and a model from a collection and has a list method and a create method

**_ Example goes here - should use both list and create methods to demonstrate type inference _**

## Define a model connector that works with a rest api and a model from a collection and has a list method and a create, update, and delete method

**_ Example goes here - should use all CRUD methods to demonstrate type inference _**
