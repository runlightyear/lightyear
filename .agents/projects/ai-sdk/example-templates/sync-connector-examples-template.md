# Sync Connector Examples

Note: Each example should demonstrate type inference by using the sync connector in a way that shows the types are properly inferred. This helps verify that the TypeScript types are working correctly.

## Define a basic sync connector that works with a rest api and a collection

**_ Example goes here _**

## Define a sync connector that works with a rest api and a collection and has a model connector with a list method

**_ Example goes here - should use the list method to demonstrate type inference _**

## Define a sync connector that works with a rest api and a collection and has a model connector with a list method and a create method

**_ Example goes here - should use both list and create methods to demonstrate type inference _**

## Define a sync connector that works with a rest api and a collection and has a model connector with a list method and a create, update, and delete method

**_ Example goes here - should use all CRUD methods to demonstrate type inference _**

## Define a duplicate sync connector of an instantiated sync connector with an additional model connector

**_ Example goes here - should use the additional model connector to demonstrate type inference _**
