**Notes**: Each example should demonstrate type inference by using the sync connector in a way that shows the types are properly inferred. This helps verify that the TypeScript types are working correctly.

## Define a basic sync connector that works with a rest api and a collection and has a model connector with a list method and an action that invokes it

**_ Example goes here _**

## Define a sync connector that works with a rest api and a collection and has a model connector with a list method and a create method and an action that invokes it

**_ Example goes here - should use the list method to demonstrate type inference _**

## Define a sync connector that works with a rest api and a collection and has a model connector with a list method and a create, update, and delete method and an action that invokes it

**_ Example goes here - should use all CRUD methods to demonstrate type inference _**
