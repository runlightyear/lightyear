# PrismJS DOM Clobbering Vulnerability Analysis (CVE-2024-53382)

## Summary

The lightyear project is affected by CVE-2024-53382, a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in PrismJS. The vulnerability exists because the project's documentation site (Docusaurus) uses `prism-react-renderer`, which bundles a vulnerable version of PrismJS (< 1.30.0).

## Vulnerability Details

- **CVE**: CVE-2024-53382
- **Type**: DOM Clobbering leading to potential XSS
- **Severity**: Moderate (CVSS not yet assigned)
- **Fixed in**: PrismJS 1.30.0
- **Current Status**: prism-react-renderer 2.4.1 bundles PrismJS < 1.30.0

## Impact Analysis

### Affected Components
1. **Direct Dependency**: `apps/docs/package.json` â†’ `prism-react-renderer@^1.3.5`
2. **Resolved Version**: prism-react-renderer@2.4.1 (based on pnpm-lock.yaml)
3. **Vulnerable Component**: Bundled PrismJS version within prism-react-renderer

### Attack Vector
The vulnerability allows DOM Clobbering when `document.currentScript` lookup can be shadowed by attacker-injected HTML elements. This can lead to XSS attacks when Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-provided) HTML content.

## Current Status

- **prism-react-renderer Latest**: 2.4.1 (released 7 months ago)
- **PrismJS Fix**: 1.30.0 (released 4 months ago)
- **Issue**: prism-react-renderer bundles its own version of Prism and hasn't been updated to include the security fix

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Monitor for Updates
Regularly check for new versions of prism-react-renderer that include the security fix:
```bash
pnpm outdated prism-react-renderer
```

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)
Implement strict CSP headers to mitigate potential XSS attacks:
```javascript
// In your Docusaurus configuration
module.exports = {
  // ... other config
  headers: [
    {
      source: '/(.*)',
      headers: [
        {
          key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
          value: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
};
```

### 3. Input Sanitization
If the documentation site accepts any user input that gets highlighted:
- Sanitize all user-provided content before passing it to syntax highlighting
- Use a library like DOMPurify to clean HTML input

### 4. Alternative Solutions

#### Option A: Use @docusaurus/theme-live-codeblock
This uses a different code highlighting approach that may not be vulnerable.

#### Option B: Direct PrismJS Usage
Consider using PrismJS directly instead of prism-react-renderer, though this would require significant refactoring.

#### Option C: Alternative Syntax Highlighters
- Shiki
- highlight.js
- CodeMirror

### 5. Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk** if: The documentation site only highlights static, trusted code examples
- **High Risk** if: The site allows user-generated content to be syntax highlighted

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Assess if your documentation site handles any user-provided content for syntax highlighting
2. **Short-term**: Implement CSP headers and content sanitization if needed
3. **Long-term**: Monitor prism-react-renderer for updates or consider alternative syntax highlighting solutions

## Tracking

- GitHub Issue: No open issues found on prism-react-renderer repository regarding CVE-2024-53382
- Dependabot Alert: #87 (currently open)
- Last Checked: January 2025

## Additional Notes

### Why this is challenging to fix:
1. **Bundled Dependency**: prism-react-renderer doesn't use PrismJS as an external dependency; it bundles a modified version internally
2. **Version Gap**: The latest prism-react-renderer (2.4.1) was released 7 months ago, while the PrismJS fix (1.30.0) was released 4 months ago
3. **Ecosystem Impact**: This affects all Docusaurus users and any React applications using prism-react-renderer for syntax highlighting

### Temporary Workarounds:
1. **For Docusaurus Users**: Consider implementing strict CSP headers at the server level
2. **For High-Risk Applications**: Consider temporarily disabling syntax highlighting for user-generated content
3. **Alternative Libraries**: Evaluate alternatives like Shiki or highlight.js if immediate mitigation is required
